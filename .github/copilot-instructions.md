# Copilot Instructions

- Maximize algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime (e.g., prefer O(n) over O(nÂ²)), balancing simplicity when efficiency gains are minimal.
- Use parallelization or vectorization for performance-critical tasks (e.g., NumPy for Python matrix operations).
- Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, camelCase for JavaScript, Google Style Guide for Java).
- Keep code concise: avoid unnecessary variables or loops unless they enhance clarity.
- Prioritize readability (e.g., descriptive variable names, clear structure) without sacrificing performance.
